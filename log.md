Today I started App Academy Open and learners about the data types number and boolean.
print is the simplest method used to print data. It will do minimal formatting and not even add a new line at the end of the print. 
print "hello"
print "world"

# the code above would print:
# helloworld

To manually add a new line you can use the character "\n". "\n" stands for "new line." This syntax is often used for other whitespace characters like tab ("\t").
print "hello\n"
print "\tworld\n"

# the code above would print:
# hello
#   world

puts
puts also prints data to the screen, but with some formatting, including adding an automatic new line after every puts:

puts "hello"
puts "world"

# the code above would print:
# hello
# world

p
p prints data to the screen with a new line but also gives information on type of data was printed:

p "hello"
p 'goodbye'
p "42"
p 42

# the code above would print:
# "hello"
# "goodbye"
# "42"
# 42
Lets notice a few things above:

it doesn't matter if we wrap a string in double quotes or single quotes, it is still a string (in a later course we'll learn a slight distinction between the two).
we are able to differentiate the string "42" from the number 42 because the p method will actually print out the quotes that wrap the string data. Very cool!

# String
puts "string".length prints the numbers of characters in a string (a space is a character too)

Today I only had a spare moment and learned about string length and indicing.
Ex. puts "Hello".length prints 5
    puts "Hello"[0] prints H, "Hello"[2] prints l

I learned about Methods and Conditionals today. I have done a bit of Freecodecamp a few years ago, so it's not completely new, but that was in JavaScript and this time it's in Ruby. I keep doubting whether it's worth spending my time on programming. I can't imagine making something by myself and don't even have an image of what you can do with Ruby. But I liked the structured way of App Academy Open, so I will continue to see where it leads me.
